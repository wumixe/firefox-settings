The settings and configurations that I use to make the Firefox browser as good as it can be.
Mozilla adds a lot of fluff to their browser that isn't needed.
They also sometimes make decisions that aren't really the best for their users.

There are many reasons to use Firefox: it's customizability, it being one of the only competitors to Chromium, or its supposed superior privacy.
Whatever the case, Firefox is a good browser that can be made the best with some modifications.

Firstly, you will download Firefox. We will now choose a search engine. I personally recommend Startpage or Brave Search. 
Each of these search engines have unique instructions on how to enable them by default in your browser.
For Brave, these instructions can be found at: https://search.brave.com/default
For Startpage, go to https://www.startpage.com and click the "Install on Firefox" button.

Now that we have chosen a privacy-respecting search engine, it is time to make other important changes to the browser.
There are many files you can use to customize the browser. These are known as user.js files. My favorite is Betterfox.
I have my own version of Betterfox (https://github.com/yokoffing/Betterfox) with custom changes, which are:

- Allowing websites to ask for my location
- Enabling container tabs
- Disabling Firefox Sync
- Enabling strict Enhanced Tracking Protection

These added settings work best for me, and if you think these additions would work best for you, add my user.js file with 
these instructions:

1. Download my (or Betterfox's) user.js file.
2. Type "about:profile" in a new tab and press Enter.
3. Click the "Open Directory" button under the "Root Directory" row.
4. Drag the user.js file into your profile's folder (the one ending in ".default").

Once you have done this, you are almost done. Now we will add uBlock Origin (https://ublockorigin.com/) to block ads and trackers.
Go to the uBlock Origin website, click "Get uBlock Origin" and then click the "Add to Firefox" button.

Now you can customize the browser however you want, as UI is subjective. You can right-click the toolbar and click the "Customize Toolbar" button to customize it.
That's it for my Firefox settings! Security and privacy can always be better, but it's also important to weigh the difficulty and convenience.
I find that this is a great solution for me to protect my privacy while not hindering my web browsing experience.
